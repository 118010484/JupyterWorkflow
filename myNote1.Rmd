```{r}
data("AirPassengers")
AP <- AirPassengers
str(AP) # Time series with 144 values from years 1949 to 1961
# number of passenger in each month in each year = 112 118 129 ...
```

```{r}
ts(AP, frequency=12, start=c(1494,1)) # because we have monthly data from 1494 from January

```

```{r}
attributes(AP) # in a year we have 12 data points from year 1949 to 1960 something month
```

```{r}
plot(AP)
```
The number of passengers are gradually going up. But there is also some amount of seasonality (there are periods of the year which are higher, some other periods are lower). This time series is definitely not stationary (THIS IS A PROBLEM)

What can we do? Log transformation
```{r}

```
